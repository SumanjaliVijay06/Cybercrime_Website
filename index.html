                <p class="fs-5 fw-semibold text-secondary">Scammers exploit vulnerabilities in online banking systems or trick users into revealing their credentials. This can happen through convincing fake login pages, malware designed to steal information, or social engineering tactics where fraudsters impersonate bank officials to gain access to your accounts. Once inside, they can transfer funds, make unauthorized purchases, or lock you out of your own finances.</p>

                <p class="fs-5 fw-semibold text-secondary">These scams leverage the trust and widespread use of WhatsApp. Fraudsters offer enticingly low-interest loans or lucrative gift schemes, often asking for an upfront "processing fee" or "tax" that is never returned. They might also promise non-existent prizes or job offers, all designed to extract personal information and money from unsuspecting victims. The sense of urgency and attractive offers are key to their deception.</p>

                <p class="fs-5 fw-semibold text-secondary">Preying on the desire for employment, these scams advertise highly paid, flexible work-from-home opportunities that don't exist. They often ask for upfront fees for "training," "background checks," or "equipment," which vanish once paid. Sometimes, they trick victims into performing tasks that unknowingly facilitate other illegal activities or steal their personal information under the guise of an employment application.</p>

                <p class="fs-5 fw-semibold text-secondary">While convenient, QR codes and UPI payments are targets for fraudsters. Scammers create fake QR codes that, when scanned, initiate unauthorized payments or lead to malicious websites. They may also send fake UPI payment requests, tricking users into entering their PIN to "receive" money, when in fact they are authorizing a payment to the scammer. Always remember: you never need to enter your PIN to receive money.</p>

                <p class="fs-5 fw-semibold text-secondary">When your social media account is hacked, attackers gain access to your personal information, contacts, and reputation. They use hacked accounts to spread misinformation, conduct phishing attacks on your friends, or even blackmail you. This often happens through weak passwords, clicking on malicious links, or falling for fake login pages. The emotional and social damage can be significant.</p>

                <p class="fs-5 fw-semibold text-secondary">Cyberbullying involves harassment or intimidation using electronic communication, often targeting individuals with repeated malicious messages or public shaming. Blackmailing takes it a step further, where perpetrators threaten to release sensitive personal information, images, or videos unless demands (often financial) are met. These acts can have severe psychological impacts on victims, causing distress, fear, and isolation.</p>

                <p class="fs-5 fw-semibold text-secondary">Card cloning, also known as skimming, involves criminals illegally copying your credit or debit card information. This is often done using devices installed on ATMs, point-of-sale terminals, or fuel pumps that capture your card details and PIN. Once cloned, a duplicate card can be created and used for fraudulent transactions, emptying your bank account without your physical card ever leaving your possession.</p>

                <p class="fs-5 fw-semibold text-secondary">Scammers create convincing replica websites of popular brands or e-commerce platforms to trick consumers into making purchases or divulging personal information. These sites often offer unbelievably low prices or exclusive deals. Victims either receive counterfeit goods, nothing at all, or have their payment and personal data stolen. Always check the URL, look for secure connection indicators (HTTPS), and read reviews before buying.</p>
